the "pwd" command gives us the present working directory of the terminal
so that should give us ~/Downloads right ! 

well ... no ... 

checking it up in terminal we get to know that output is : 
/home/<username>/Downloads
so as Username is elli0t in that image 
we know that pwd will give the output as 

FLAG : /home/elli0t/Downloads
