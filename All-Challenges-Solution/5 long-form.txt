this one is actully pretty simple, we need to go to the folder and just make a file with name "hello.txt" and run an executable that will give us the flag when it sees the file that we made 

>> Word of caution , choose the folder and shell scripts according to your system otherwise the executable won't work !


after choosing your system folder (my case 64 bit)
go in folder, make a file hello.txt using 

$ touch hello.txt

and then run the executable with 

$ ./executable 

to reveal the flag 

FLAG : b96ba508e3690f5168e4b0e68b15b178
