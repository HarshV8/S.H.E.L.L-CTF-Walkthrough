i realised that i forgot how to open a file with "-" in its name 
i was getting erros again and again!
so i decided to take a different approach!

i would just rename the file to something simpler :p 
now even "mv" command will need escaping so i could not use that
i decided to use my favourite language python for it !
python3 os module renames the file to "simple.txt" and then it can be diretly seen
using the "cat" function! 
#Easy Trick!

$ python3
>>> import os
>>> files = os.listdir()
>>> files
[<awkward file name>]
>>> os.rename(files[0],"simple.txt")
>>> os.system("cat simple.txt")

>>> exit()


Although i also had an idea later on, that "cat *" would be much easier as it will cat out all files in that directory
(only one in this case) so ... 
$ cat *
boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1
could also be used!
