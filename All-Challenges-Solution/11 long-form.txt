this is easier than it looks ! 
:p 

you can have multiple approaches but this one works just fine 
we can use "find" command to find the "file 11" for us 

so : -

$ find . -type df -name "file 11"

that gives us the location that the file is in folder 91 
then 

$ cd "may be here 91"
$ cat "file 11"
gives us the flag
