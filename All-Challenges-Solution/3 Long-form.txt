this is much like the 2nd question (folder 2)
but before we can use the "cat *" to echo out all we need to do something better for it to be valid

i chose my swiss-army-knife(python3) again, running a very similar code 
and in the end printing out the flag was easy 

$ python3

>>> import os
>>> x=0
>>> files = os.listdir()
>>> for file in files:
....    os.rename(file,str(x))
....    x+=1

>>> os.system("cat *")
t����W��Lvd���3q�
�&��ڛ��[̹2�Ui,

koReBOKuIDDepwhWk7jZC0RTdopnAYKh

+���z�C|����M�	�rkA����A���L�
0

>>> exit()


now that is extra data, but the flag is clearly the string, so 

FLAG : koReBOKuIDDepwhWk7jZC0RTdopnAYKh
