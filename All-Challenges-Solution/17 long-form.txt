this one is about file permissions ! 
we simply need to get the executing permission for the file then run it !

so : the "chmod" command will help us !

$ cd 64bit
$ chmod +x executable
$ ./executable

that will give us the flag when we execute it ! 

the flag is : FLAG : aab4b125bca447f96d4fe7920863a1ed
